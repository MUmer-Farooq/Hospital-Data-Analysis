# Hospital-Data-Analysis
I recently worked on a professional, interactive, and visually engaging dashboard designed to transform hospital data
 into actionable insights for both patients and doctors.

Using Excel,SQL and Power BI I connected, cleaned, and visualized complex healthcare data 
to provide clear performance tracking and better decision-making for hospital management.

Key Features:

Patients dashboard: appointments, treatment types, gender distribution, payment methods, reasons for visit, monthly trends

Doctors dashboard: appointment counts, insurance breakdown, specializations, revenue performance, years of experience, patient trends

Interactive filters, drill-down features, and clean design for maximum usability

Skills & Tools:
Excel(for cleaning and organizing the data into multiple sheet)
SQL (for joining the tables and and fetch the important columns)
Power Bi (to create the dashboard for the easy visualization)

ðŸ’¡ Perfect for: Hospitals, clinics, healthcare analytics, and management reporting.

If youâ€™re looking to make your healthcare data easier to understand and act on, letâ€™s connect!
